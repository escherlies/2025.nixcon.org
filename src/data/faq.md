## How do I plan and book public transport?

The easiest way is to use the [SBB website](https://www.sbb.ch/en) or their [SBB Mobile app](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travel-information/apps/sbb-mobile.html).

## What is the cheapest way to travel by public transport?

For the arrival you can try to buy one of the [limited day passes for Switzerland](https://www.sbb.ch/en/buying/pages/kontingent/kontingent.xhtml).

During the conference you can buy a [24h-ticket for the Zürich region](https://www.zvv.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/24h-tickets.html) or the [9 o'clock day pass](https://www.zvv.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/9-oclock-day-pass.html).

Both are available from [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/en) as well.

## What is special about the hotels in the 'Accommodation' menu?
